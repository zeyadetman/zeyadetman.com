Hi, whatever you use to organize your tasks, you only need three types of lists in your todo app to organize everything in your days.

Before diving in, the most important part of organizing your days is the consistency, and to achieve that you have to keep track of your tasks and lists everyday, so creating as little as possible of lists will help you to decrease the amount of time and effort to give an eye on your tasks, and this is the benefit of having only 3 types of lists in your todo list app.

## Watch list

The watch list is a reminder list that tracks everything you’ve already done but still has pending revisions. For example, you made a call to a friend, and he said he’d check on something and get back to you. You’re waiting for his response before you can move forward. Another example is when you’re working on a task but are blocked by a teammate, waiting for their pending action to finish your work. Or, it could be a project you’ve submitted for review, but you’re still waiting for feedback before making the final adjustments.

## Todo list

The second list that you have to add to your app, is the todo app, this list should includes the tasks that have priority or defined date or deadline. For example, if you plan to go for a trip and you need to buy a bag, or reserve the flight, another example, when you plan your day, put them in todo list, when you do plans put them in todo list.

Essentially, Any planned task should go there.

## Later List

The third list, the “Later” list, includes wishes and low-priority tasks — things you’d like to do but don’t have any immediate plans for. For example, if you want to start a YouTube channel but don’t have the time to focus on it right now, you can check your notes on it later when you have time. Another example would be wanting to organize your clothes, but without any set plans to do it right now.

### Extra Notes

This system will be more powerful and efficient, with Tags, So using tags like (to buy, to sell, work, life, daily. …etc) will make your lists more efficient to sort through and keep you more focused while browsing the tasks.
