Ok, this is a quick tutorial on how to customize the default theme in [mui v5](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/). we'll just customize the button component.

Project Template [here](https://github.com/zeyadetman/ts-mui-nextjs-storybook-boilerplate)

## First thing, let's create our folder structure.

Our folder structure is one of the basic setup we will do on our tutorial. it helps us to know where we will write our code in an organized way.
Ok, so I prefer this structure while setup any theming whatever the ui framework I use.

```bash
.
â””â”€â”€ theme/
    â”œâ”€â”€ foundations/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ palette.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ typography.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ button.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
    â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

Now, we have two main folder, the first one will be `foundations` folder, and it used for basic theme variables, and the other one is `components` for components theming.
In each folder we created `index.ts` file to export all from it.

## _Next,_ let's build the theme from the end to beginning.

open the `theme/index.ts` to import our `foundations` and `components` that structure our theme

```ts
import { components } from "theme/components";
import { foundations } from "./foundations";
import { createTheme, ThemeOptions } from "@mui/material";

const themeOptions: Omit<ThemeOptions, "components"> = {
  ...foundations,
};

export const theme: ThemeOptions = createTheme({
  ...themeOptions,
  components: {
    ...components,
  },
});
```

No magic, ha?
`ThemeOptions` will perfectly handles the types for the passed properties. We excluded the `components` from `themeOptions` vars and passed it inside the `createTheme` function, you can modify it to update it directly inside the variable.

We need to customize the `theme` colors for example, it called `palette` and its type is `PaletteOptions`

So here's our `theme/foundations/palette.ts`

```ts
import { PaletteOptions } from "@mui/material";

export const palette: PaletteOptions = {
  common: {
    white: "#fff",
    black: "#000",
  },
  primary: {
    main: "#33A3FF",
    light: "#53B1FD66",
  },
};
```

And because we've used the correct Interface so the editor will help us continue writing the remain properties

**The Question** will be, What if I need to add a new color schema.
**The Answer** is Simple as this

```ts
declare module "@mui/material/styles" {
  export interface PaletteOptions {
    blue?: PaletteColorOptions;
  }
}
```

How did I know about `PaletteColorOptions` ? it's not a magic, I clicked on `PaletteOptions` and checked the type for the already existing colors schema.

Ok, until now everything is super easy right?

## What about customizing the components theme?

Ok ok, the MUI Button component located [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/) and they call it [`MuiButton`](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/button/#component-name).
But let's create the `components` object that will be exported inside the `createTheme`.

and it's simple as this `theme/components/index.ts`

```ts
import { Components } from "@mui/material";

export const components: Components = {};
```

after that TS will help you writing your components.

![](/assets/Pasted%20image%2020221123062847.png)

First thing, let's create our type for the `MuiButton` component theme, open the `theme/components/button.ts`

```ts
type muiButton = {
  defaultProps?: ComponentsProps["MuiButton"];
  styleOverrides?: ComponentsOverrides<Theme>["MuiButton"];
  variants?: ComponentsVariants["MuiButton"];
};
```

We got it from the `.d.ts` file located in the mui package files inside the `node_modules` folder. No magic!

[Note: Feel free to use interfaces or types for this.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#differences-between-type-aliases-and-interfaces)

After that let's create our custom theme for `MuiButton`

```ts
declare module "@mui/material/Button" {
  export interface ButtonPropsVariantOverrides {
    isActive: true;
  }
}

export const MuiButton: muiButton = {
  variants: [
    {
      props: { variant: "isActive" },
      style: ({ theme }: { theme: Theme }) => {
        return {
          color: theme.palette.common.white,
        };
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

1. I created a new variant for the `Button` you can use it inside your code.
2. TS will be your guide while customizing the component.

_Note: I added `export` word before `interface ButtonPropsVariantOverrides` to avoid the eslint rule_ [`unused-imports/no-unused-vars`](https://github.com/sweepline/eslint-plugin-unused-imports/blob/master/docs/rules/no-unused-imports.md)

Now, We need to wrap our app with this theme

```tsx
import { theme } from "theme";

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
```

Tada! ðŸŽ‰
